# Microscopic Content Expansion mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous 
## Requirements: [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases).

Add microscopic amount of new features. May or may not grow further in scope. The latter is more likely.   

## Featuring

### New classes: 

[Antipaladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/antipaladin)   
Archetypes available:  
- [Iron Tyrant](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/antipaladin/archetypes/paizo-antipaladin-archetypes/iron-tyrant-antipaladin-archetype/)
- [Knight of the Sepulcher](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/antipaladin/archetypes/paizo-antipaladin-archetypes/knight-of-the-sepulcher)
- [Tyrant](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/antipaladin/archetypes/paizo-antipaladin-archetypes/tyrant-antipaladin-archetype/)

IMPORTANT: For best experience also install TabletopTweaks-Base. Fiendish template for antipaladin animal companion and Armor Mastery/Shield Mastery feats that can be picked as Iron Tyrant bonus feats are used from TTT. If you don't have TTT-Base, mod will still work, just you will be missing additional possible selections. (No, I won't copypaste those in my mod, don't ask)

WARNING: Alignment restrictions do not have mythic bypass clause. You stop being evil and you lose spellbook and active abilities. This is intended.
